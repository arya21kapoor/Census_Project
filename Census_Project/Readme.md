In this project we have developed a state ranking system using the census 2011 data. 
Each district in a state is ranked on relevant attributes like the Assets possessed by the people and the quality of their homes.  
MCDA (Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding) algorithms have been used extensively in developing this ranking system.
