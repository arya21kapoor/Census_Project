    <h1 class="display-6">1) Why hyderabad secures 1st position?</h1>
    <h1 class="display-6">Hyderabad secures the first position because it has the least percentage of dilapidated
      houses. Having dilapidated houses has a negative impact on the points for NOH (Number of Households) Score.
      Besides this attribute Hyderabad has also performed well in other aspects like only 1% of the population is not
      having bathrooms while in other cities like Delhi the number is as high as 14%.
      A good proportion of the city has a proper waste water outlet and proper latrine facilities which also influences
      the points secured by the district. This also one of the primary reasons for Mumbai scoring less points despite
      being the financial capital.
    </h1>

    <h1 class="display-6">2) Why Delhi Secures second position?</h1>
    <h1 class="display-6">Delhi secures the second position as it has the least percentage of houses having no
      lightning. Having more number of houses with no lightning has a negative impact on MSL (Main Source of Lightning)
      Score.
      Delhi has performed well when it comes to number of households not having domestic rooms it is as low as 0.45%
      which helps it to secure second position.

    </h1>

    <h1 class="display-6">3) Why Chandigarh secures third position?</h1>
    <h1 class="display-6" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Chandigarh secures the third position as it has less number of houses having no lightning and
      also lesser number of dilapidated houses. It has performed well in other attributes which fetch negative points.
      Hence it is ab.le to secure third position
